# Data structures

Here are my c++ implementations of basic data structures: Vector, LinkedList, HashMap and Tree (AVL). All of those structurec have implemented all methods, that are available in standard library. All of those structures passed all meticulous boost tests.

This project was developed during my studies at Warsaw University of Technology, on Algorithms and Data Structures.
